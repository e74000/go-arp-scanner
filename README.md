# Simple ARP Scanner

A simple ARP scanner I wrote in go to learn about TUIs and ARP.

I haven't yet implemented scrolling, so it isn't that functional right now.

Please don't use this for anything important, since this is only a hobby project, so I cannot make any guarantees about it working or anything else.

## How to use:

- Run the program from a terminal as root,
- Select your favorite network interface,
- Select which IP address to use, (Only IPv4 is supported)
- Profit!
